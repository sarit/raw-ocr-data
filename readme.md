# Raw double-keyboarding data for Sanskrit texts
This repository contains the raw double-keyboarding data for projects undertaken at Columbia University between 2012 and 2015. In those projects, TEI markup was applied to this data, and as the texts were completed, they were moved to the [SARIT-corpus](https://github.com/sarit/SARIT-corpus) repository, the authoritative repository for texts produced in the [SARIT](https://sarit.indology.info/) project.

## Scripts
Each raw file is available in the Devanagari script (in which it was originally typed up), as well as automatically-produced transliterations in the IAST and ISO-15919 romanization schemes.

## Markup
Most of the raw files include some markup that was introduced during double-keyboarding.
